# void-customizations
These are my own personal customizations to make things look a little more consistent and shiny. 
Check out customize.sh if you want to see what is happening and try it out for yourself. 
But be warned, it doesn't backup anything and use it at your own risk.

I don't have any claims to rights on the artwork used in this repo. It's just stuff I found 
over my time with Void that I liked and kept. So don't do stupid things with it, or do idk I'm 
not the cops.
